<h1>• AG Grid Basics</h1>
<p>AG Grid: A highly customizable and feature-rich data grid for JavaScript frameworks. It supports large datasets and provides capabilities such as sorting, filtering, grouping, and pagination.</p>
<h2>• Use Case: Restaurant Data Management</h2>
<p>Data Types: For a restaurant management system, typical data fields might include:
    Name: The name of the restaurant.
    Address: The physical address of the restaurant.
    Pincode: The postal code or ZIP code.
    City: The city where the restaurant is located.
    State: The state or province.
    </p>
    <h2>• Integration Steps</h2>
    <p>Setup: Integrate AG Grid into your Angular project by installing the necessary packages and importing the AG Grid modules.
        Configuration: Define the grid's column structure and data source. For restaurant data, columns would be set up to match the fields like Name, Address, Pincode, etc.
        Data Binding: Connect the grid to a data source containing the restaurant information. This could be static data or fetched from an API.</p>
<h2>• Features and Customization</h2>
<p>Sorting: Allow users to sort restaurant data by any column (e.g., sorting by name or city).
    Filtering: Enable filtering to help users find specific restaurants based on criteria (e.g., filtering by state or pincode).
    Pagination: Implement pagination to manage large datasets effectively, displaying only a subset of data at a time.
    Editing: Provide functionalities for users to edit restaurant details directly within the grid, if needed.</p>
<h2>• User Interface</h2>
<p>Themes and Styles: AG Grid offers customizable themes that can be styled to match your application’s design. For instance, you might use the "alpine" theme for a modern look.
    Responsive Design: Ensure the grid is responsive and performs well on various devices and screen sizes.
</p>
<h2>• Advanced Features</h2>
<p>Row Grouping: Group data based on specific criteria (e.g., group restaurants by city or state).
    Custom Cell Rendering: Customize how data is displayed in each cell (e.g., use custom components for better visualization of restaurant data).
    Aggregation: Aggregate data for summary purposes (e.g., total number of restaurants in each city).
    In summary, AG Grid provides a robust and flexible solution for managing and displaying restaurant data within an Angular application. It allows you to create an interactive and user-friendly data grid that supports various features and customizations to meet the needs of restaurant management.</p>
